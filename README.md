# STLRulesEvolutionaryInferenceNoClass

This is the official repository for the Applied Sciences paper "Mining Road Traffic Rules with Signal Temporal Logic and Grammatical Evolution", hosting all the code necessary to replicate the experiments. This work is mostly based on Federico Pigozzi's master's thesis and was carried on at the Machine Learning Laboratory (MaLeLab) at the Department of Engineering and Architecture, University of Trieste (Italy).

## Scope

## Structure

## Dependencies
The project relies on:
* [JGEA](https://github.com/ericmedvet/jgea), for the evolutionary optimization;
* [MoonLight](https://github.com/MoonLightSuite/MoonLight), for the monitoring of signal-temporal logic formulae.

The relative jars have already been included in the directory `libs`. See `pom.xml` for more details on dependencies.

## Bibliography
TODO, if accepted
